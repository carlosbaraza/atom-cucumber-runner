# Atom Cucumber Runner Package

----

Total rip-off of the atom-rspec package, but runs cucumber instead. I should
refactor the common bits out, but for now I just wanted something working. I'm
lazy like that, which isn't really the good kind of lazy. *Sigh*

-----

Add ability to run Cucumber and see the output without leaving Atom.

HotKeys:

- __Ctrl+Alt+K f__ - executes current feature file
- __Ctrl+Alt+K l__ - executes only the cuke on the line the cursor's at
- __Ctrl+Alt+E__ - re-executes the last executed cuke
